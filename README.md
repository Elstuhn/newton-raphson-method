# newton-raphson-method
Newton-raphson method in code


# Things To Note
- **The lower threshold, the more accurate the roots, however, the program will take longer to run**
- **A basic visual understanding of the polynomial will help you tinker the parameters for optimised runtime, however, there is always brute-force**
- **If you get an error saying name 'cache' is not defined, just remove the @cache, it requires python 3.9 and above to be run**
